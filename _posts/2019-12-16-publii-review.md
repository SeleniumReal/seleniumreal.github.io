Over the past few years, I have been using Tumblr and Blogger to host my regular blogging content. For a simple blog, both were good enough for me to write and store my content in just a few clicks. Both services were adequate enough for me to keep using them, not have to worry about coding up a website from scratch or using an approach that would not have the same guarentee of uptime.

But what if there was a better solution that guarenteed the uptime I wanted, took the same amount of clicks, and had a few extra bonuses added on to the software, inlcuding the ability to work on my blog without the internet? An open source static website creator, Publii helped me achieve these goals and even had extra benefits that leave Blogger for good.

## What is Publii?

Publii is an open source static website generator that lets you easily make an HTML website without having to jump into coding or make a website from scratch. Licensed under the Gnu Public License v3, Publii is made with modern web technologies that are used to build modern applications, such as Electron, Webpack, and Vue. Some of these technologies are even used in regular websites that you browse online. Electron allows you to easily build cross-platform applications without worrying about compatibility between operating systems. This means that Publii can be used on either Windows, Mac, or Linux without having to use seperate source code for each platform.

The blogging software can also be used offline thanks to these technologies being available without having an internet connection. This is great for being able to write blog posts without having to worry about having to be online. This is great if you want to bring your laptop somewhere disconnected such as a camp ground. Publishing the website does, however, require an internet connection if you wish to share your blog with your friends, family members, and people you wouldn’t be able to reach locally, such as your distant relatives.

Another advantage is that the website that Publii finally produces is static. As opposed to dynamic websites such as those made with web software such as WordPress, the code that is placed on the server will be the same as the code that the client recieves. All pages that the reader recieves are displayed “as-is”, without further modification by the host.

*Side Note: I’ve written about using static blogging software as opposed to dynamic blogging software in the past. If this post interests you, [there is a post](<>) on the Aclevo Blog that you can read to learn more about them.*

## The Main Interface

Publii features a great interface that is straight-forward and easy to use. Every time you start Publii, you will see the Posts screen. (Please note that you do need to create a website first or else Publii will have you set one up first. Setting one up is fast and easy, and you will be glad you did.) It lists all the posts you have wrote with the title, date of publication, and author right on one page. Creating a new blog post is as simple as clicking the green “Add new post” button on the top right and getting right into making something fabulous.

Writing a blog post is really without any hastle with Publii. The interface is suitable for non-programmers and even those who do not have experience in web or graphic design. The interface is also clean so that bloggers do not have to get overwelmed to write. All of the settings related to these posts, including metadata like whether it is published, a featured image, tags, search engine optimization tools, and other cool options that can let you, for example, make a webpage instead. I would agree, however, that it is confusing to have to add a webpage as a blog and not have a seperate button which automates the process including the settings that are required.

In the end, while it may take some getting used to, Publii is a great option for making good content for readers without having to set up a external web server or use a terminal, command prompt, or text editor. Creators can get their work done fast and easily without the downsides or requirements of other similar but heavier tools out there. This is just the surface of what Publii can accomplish that can be explained in a single blog post.

*Side Note: For those who are interested, Publii has great documentation on their website about how you can install the software, create a website, install a different theme, and how to push your website to the public where everybody can see it. There’s also information about how to setup translations, add Google search to your blog, and even how to add your own comments section without any hastle using Disqus. [See the documentation](<>) to find out more information.*

## Conclusion

I encourage you to learn more about the software and how it works by [visiting their website](<>) and downloading it for yourself to try out. You can also [view the source](<>) at GitHub if you are interested. As a person who used to use other blogging platforms, I am happy to say that Publii is a great option for me, even to the point where it can replace Blogger and Tumblr all together. I don’t even have to be on the internet to use it either, and readers can access the website easily without any trouble. It was definitely worth migrating all of my posts and metadata to make the switch, and I think the same for any writers who are interested. What a great way to start a new year with a new tool!
