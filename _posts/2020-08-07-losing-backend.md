There are some good advantages and disadvantages to having a static website instead of a dynamic one in the age of the JAMstack. Trusted and identical server-client code, minimal hosting services that can be found for free, and the fact that uptime can be more guaranteed than some PHP dinosaur that might become extinct in the next few centuries. Joking aside, not everyone can stand the idea of trying to write blog posts in pure plain text, especially trying to visualize how a YouTube video or an image, for instance. Computers have come a long way since MS-DOS, and having a visual clue as to how the final touches should look is a blessing to our generation.



Hence the idea of the Headless Content Management System was born, where managing content could be done on a different server that has the capability to display the final product before shipment. Being able to use an WYSIWYG editor not only is beautiful for the eyes, but soothing for the brain as words appear across the screen with your favorite styling (no paintbrush required) and the photos of your latest family vacation you always wanted to share with your friends. The struggles of having to jump over cactus and avoiding mystical flying creatures and seeing a piece of paper with a sad face on it has become a thing of the past, or has it?



While your readers definitely won't have to navigate through that trouble, the fact of boring them with an absentee of blogging is still a blogger's nightmare as the visual interface to write the blog posts gets accidentally stolen by a kangaroo on the other side of the planet, leaving the writer's dreams doubtful and malcontent. If only there were more motivation to continue the project so easily without having to redevelop the website you spent precious time working on. All of the drafts you were working on cease to exist and considered something you would hopefully find in the graveyard.



At least you have the content you published right on the Internet ready to download and migrate over to your brave new back end, giving some benefit to sticking with the idea of the JAMStack. Even the business hosting the static front end is still functioning very well and never let down their promise of being the best place to keep things functional. However, writing a pessimistic blog post will definitely not help you nor your peers adjust to the fact that change is eventually mostly involuntary, despite interpretation and communication. Taking intermediate pauses and enjoying the pleasure and displeasure of life however can sometimes provide relief outside of mindful drafting.
