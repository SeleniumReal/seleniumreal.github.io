## Who I Am
I am Reasonably Selenium, a content creator from New England that has experience in business ownership, foreign languages, graphic design, logo design, story writing, spreadsheet editing, video editing, song production, and creating ideas. I’ve used several tools in the past to create my content, and I currently use open source software as opposed to proprietary software in order to show my support for the FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) movement. Manjaro Linux is my primary operating operating system that I use every day on my main computer, which is a free and open source operating system based on Arch Linux.

My goals are to help people with disabilities make great art, encourage people with disabilities to accept themselves for the way they are, and to help them find friends who have the same or similar problems. I myself have a disability known as Autism Spectrum Disorder, a mental disability that changes the way my brain perceives certain things. By helping people with what I have, as well as similar conditions, I hope to bring positivity and support from what I have experienced, to better the lives of people like me.

## **FAQ**
**How much content can I expect for you to post? Do you have a schedule?**

I usually create content when I feel like it on an occasional basis. I don’t really have a schedule for this, so it’s usually whenever I feel like doing it. Please do not expect me to post regularly scheduled content on this blog as I currently have no plans to do so.

**What type of content do you usually like to create?**

Usually I create the type of content I am interested in making at the moment, such as when I get an idea and want to try it out, or I see something I want to talk about. When I do decide to make content, it is most likely related to either gaming, programming, music, blogging, video production, and similar.

*Side Note: While I may consider consolidating my content in the future, I am currently not publishing rants or stories to this website. If you are interested, I do have a Tumblr and a DeviantArt for those audiences. Viewer discretion is advised when reading these, and no link will be provided on this about page.*

**Are you going to be publishing a biography here?**

Please read the answer above, specifically the one in italics.

**Do you take requests for new content to create?**

Sorry, I do not take requests to make content. I make it whenever I feel like it. Feel free to suggest some things though.

**Is there anyway I can contact you whenever I feel like it?**

There are many ways to get in touch with me whenever you wish to chat. Below is a list of social media accounts as well as my Discord for easy friend requesting. Thank you for not sending too many friend requests per day.
