    Welcome back to my blog. It's been some time since I've made a blog post, and I thought I'd talk about what's new and what's to come. I also thought it would be a good time to talk about what happened to Aclevo, why I restarted it, and why I decided to merge with Cob:web Development. For those of you who are looking for an explaination as to what happened with Treehouse Communities Discord, I will also be discussing some big changes surrounding it.

## Website Update
First things first, I decided to update my website. The old one wasn't really working for me, and ever since taking the role as Director in the newly merged Cob:web-Aclevo (more on that soon), I felt it was necessary to make some changes. I thank everyone in Cw:A's Discord for helping me make my website more accessible to others, as well as giving me their opinions on the general theme.

### Switching To GitHub Pages
Switching to GitHub Pages from using Gridsome took some work, but was worth it for the benefits of using it's backend, Jekyll, as opposed to the latter, Vue. Writing up a website in Jekyll doesn't require the use of JavaScript, which is less code that the website has to load. I also now get to use the .github.io subdomain to host my website and share my content to the world by switching over. This has an extra benefit of gaining a bigger influence on GitHub as opposed to elsewhere, seeing as I am primarily working on this platform now as opposed to other platforms such as GitLab or BitBucket.

### Switching to Dark Mode
After discussing with the people in the Cob:web-Aclevo Discord, it was apparent that light mode was uncomfortable on the eyes. I decided it was a great idea to switch my website to dark mode so that way it's more accessible to people who can't tolerate bright lights, especially with screens. I personally used dark mode on most applications that suppoorted it anyway, making it questionable why I would put my website in light mode. Upon chatting with my friends, I found a good theme that worked pretty well with the website and I plan to keep it this way unless someone else has a better suggestion for how the website should work color-scheme wise.

### Cleaning Up the Website
As part of the update, I remove some bloat from the website in order to keep things neat and clean. Some of the "About Me" page has been changed to be more professional and get rid of unnecessary detail that would describe myself more than what should be out there. Blog posts that felt unprofessional to the purpose of the website have been removed for obvious reasons, including that one post where I ranted about not being able to use a backend for some reason. Currently, I'm fine with typing up blog posts without having to use a backend, using a text editor called NeoVim. 

## Treehouse Communities Update
Second of all, my friend whyAdamSalt noticed that the previous model of the Discord wasn't going to work in order to gain more traction. Especially with the new Cob:web-Aclevo Discord being more popular, this made me reconsider the idea of having my public Discord with multiple categories and what direction it should go in. After thinking for a bit, I decided that I would change Treehouse Communities into my own personal Discord and remove everything that wasn't necessary for it's growth.

### Chatroom and Role Cleanup
As part of changing Treehouse Communities into my personal Discord, I knew I needed to make some changes, and that meant geting rid of a few chatrooms and starting some chatrooms fresh. I downloaded archives of the old chatrooms and then deleted all of them, remaking the ones I needed for the new goal of the Discord. Star Roles were removed and so were their respective channels as my server keeps all members at an equal status now. Partnership roles were removed as I do not do partnerships in my server anymore.

### Laying off Inactive Staff
As well as inactive chatrooms and roles, here were a lot of inactive staff that didn't really do anything. While some did monitor the server, others were just taking up a position as part of their role. While this might have been required for the previous goal, my personal Discord no longer needs to be filled with people to function correctly as I'm only looking for friends and acquaintances interested in hanging around. Because of this, I decided to lay off some staff that I felt did not meet the requirements for their positions. While I do appreciate that they would serve these roles, I feel that less and more active staff for my server is a better idea rather than having free Staff waiting for a security breach to happen.

### Bot Removal and Deprecation
The final stage of my cleanup was getting rid of all the unnecessary bots in my Discord. Too many of them were used to promote the server, which became an issue with the new goal, and the server became overcomplicated thanks to the amount of bots being used to moderate it. I didn't want to continue using all of them, especially as there won't be as many members to moderate after I removed anyone who was inactive. I decided to kick all of the bots that were used to promote the server as I am no looking for free promotions, and I kicked most of the moderation bots except for the ones I needed to keep the server running. I am considering looking into native Discord solutions for the problems where bots are needed and making a custom bot where a solution can't be solved natively. I am unsure about how to deal with the bot situation correctly however, and I will write an update post on my Discord once I am happy with a solution.

## Merging Aclevo with Cob:web Development
Last but not least, it's time to answer a big question... Why merge with Cob:web Development?
