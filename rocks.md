# Stuff That Rocks
## (Idea inspired by [whyAdamSalt](https://whyadamsalt.github.io/) and [TheEvilSkeleton](https://theevilskeleton.gitlab.io))

## Linux Distributions:

- [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/): My current operating system / It's a rolling release, DIY distribution that has great documentation and backend user intuitiveness.
> Great middle ground to source-based distributions and preconfigured distributions. ~ TheEvilSkeleton
- [CelOS](https://celos.cobweb-aclevo.org/): A user-friendly, Flatpak-centric distribution based on Ubuntu LTS by whyAdamSalt.

## Desktop Environments/Window Managers:

- [Sway](https://swaywm.org/): My current window manager / A Wayland/Wl-Roots Window Manager based on the ideas of i3-gaps.

- [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/): My previous desktop environment / A beautiful, innovative QT desktop environment that uses Wayland technology.

- [GNOME](https://gnome.org/): A beautiful, innovative GTK desktop environment that uses Wayland technology.
