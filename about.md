## Who I Am

I am Reasonably Selenium, a content creator from New England. I love open source software and I encourage people to use it instead of proprietary garbage. The organization I co-own works toward only making free and open source software so that everyone can enjoy software they can easily look at the code for and perhaps even use it in their own projects. Arch Linux is my primary operating operating system that I use every day on my main computer, which is a free and open source operating system.

My goals are to help people with disabilities express their inner talents. I myself have a disability known as Autism Spectrum Disorder, a mental disability that changes the way my brain perceives certain things. I hope to bring positivity and support from what I have experienced, to better the lives of people like me.

## **FAQ**

**Where are you most active these days?**

These days, I am currently active on the Cob:web-Aclevo Discord, whom I develop projects for as well as myself. Please feel free to check us out at [https://cobweb-aclevo.org](https://cobweb-aclevo.org).

**What type of content do you usually like to create?**

Usually I create the type of content I am interested in making at the moment, such as when I get an idea and want to try it out, or I see something I want to talk about. When I do decide to make content, it is most likely related to either gaming, programming, music, blogging, video production, and similar.

**Is there anyway I can contact you whenever I feel like it?**

There are many ways to get in touch with me whenever you wish to chat. I currently prefer chatting using Discord, so feel free to send a friend request and we can talk. You can also join the Cob:web-Aclevo Discord, which is located on our website.
